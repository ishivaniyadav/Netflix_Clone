# Netflix_Clone
This project replicates Netflix's homepage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, enriching it with interactive features through the TMDB API. It enables users to browse and discover trending movies and TV shows seamlessly integrated into the design. The layout closely resembles Netflix's aesthetic, providing a familiar user experience. JavaScript ensures smooth navigation and dynamic content loading, enhancing engagement. Developers can study its structure, styling techniques, and API integration for learning purposes or contribute to its evolution. This project serves as a practical playground for aspiring developers to sharpen their skills while recreating a popular web interface.
